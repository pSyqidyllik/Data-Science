### -A set of exercises that I have answered as to represent my skills in data science using Python with SciKit-learn such as:
- Knowing the feature of a data set with apparent correlation from Seaborn Pairplot.
  - ![](images/show1.png)
- Training a model like Linear Regression, with given data set. 
  - ![](images/show2.png)
- Predicting the future data with given model, and comparing it with test set, by plotting both in scatter plot.
  - ![](images/show3.png)
- Making a conclusion based on calculated values like coefficients of the model.
